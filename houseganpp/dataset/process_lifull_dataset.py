"""
This file will prepare the lifull dataset (housegan_clean_data.npy or train_data.npy/valid_data.npy) for training and validation in HeteroHouseGAN++

Inputs:
  
  A .npy file (housegan_clean_data.npy or train_data.npy/valid_data.npy) with the following information:
    *** House-GAN Dataset ***

    This dataset contains 145,811 floorplans in vector format utilized for training House-GAN. The data is organized in a list format, where each element represents one floorplan. For each floorplan in the dataset we have the following elements (in order):

    1) List of room types: mapping between room types and their corresponding class. ROOM_CLASS = {"exterior_wall": 0, "living_room": 1, "kitchen": 2, "bedroom": 3, "bathroom": 4, "missing": 5, "closet": 6, "balcony": 7, "corridor": 8, "dining_room": 9, "laundry_room": 10}

    2) List of room bounding boxes: each bounding box is represented by [x0, y0, x1, y1], where (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) are bottom-left and top-right coordinates, respectively.

    3) List of floorplan edges: edges in the floorplan are represented by [x0, y0, x1, y1, *, *], where (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) are the edges endpoints and elements * are not being used (internally used by raster-to-vector).

    4) Edge to room mapping: for each edge we assign up to 2 rooms sharing that edge, normally we have 2 rooms for internal edges and 1 room for edges in the building footprint, cases with 0 room per edge (should not happen) are likely vectorization/processing errors.

    5) Doors to edges list: an element "i" in this list means that the i-th edge contains a door.

    6) Vector to RGB mapping: this field contains the name of the original RGB image from LIFULL dataset.

    
Outputs:
  
  A modified .npy file named "HHGPP_(train/eval)_data.npy" with the following information:
    A list of lists with entries defined below (length == number of valid LIFULL floorplans)
      "bbs": all graph node bounding boxes in an Nx4 list, including exterior wall nodes (need to expand the EW edges into single pixel-wide bbs).
      "nds": all graph nodes in an Nx11 list, with each node represented as a one-hot encoded vector with 11 classes. see one_hot_embedding below.
      "eds": all graph edges in a Ex3 list, with each edge represented as [src_node_id, +1/-1, dest_node_id] where +1 indicates an edge is present, -1 otherwise
      "nds_f": all graph node features in an Nx2 list. 
      "eds_f": all graph edge types & features in an Nx3 list, with each entry represented as [edge type (0 - CE, or 1 - RA), edge feature 1, edge feature 2]

      Note that N == number of graph nodes, and E == number of graph edges
