Things we talked about yesterday:

Need to finish training dataset for DGMG to confirm operational (Alex)

Need to obtain sets of node and edge features for each training house (Alex's scripts should be able to pull this out)

Need to modify the housegan_clean_data.npy file to include these node and edge features as additional dictionary entries

Need to modify dataset/dataloader to pull out the node and edge features for each training sample

Need to expand the node type vector to have our number of room types and space for the exterior wall features (other rooms get -1)

Need to add layers before CMP.encode() to incorporate edge features in pooled messages from neighbors. This will be difficult. Expect to expand the edge features into a volume to cat with node features. Need to consider the bidirectional nature of our edges. Need to consider how housegan uses pos/neg edges and whether or not we need to do that.
